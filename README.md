Software Engineer and aspiring Game Developer
---------------------------------------------

I have been learning development for close to 10 years, got into coding by watching Bucky Roberts teach Java, didn't have a clue until a friend helped me out with the basics(HTML & CSS) then PHP, Javascript and so on. I would love to be part of a AAA game development some day and working towards achieving that in the not so distant future. Available to chat and collaborate on game projects.
